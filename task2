//Document Object

1.The Document Object represents the HTML document itself and provides access to its content. It is commonly referred to as the DOM (Document Object Model). Here are some key characteristics of the Document Object:

2.Structure of the HTML Document: The Document Object represents the entire structure of an HTML document, including elements like <html>, <head>, <body>, and all other HTML tags and their attributes.

3.Accessing and Manipulating Elements: One of the primary purposes of the Document Object is to enable developers to access and manipulate HTML elements within the document. You can use methods like getElementById, querySelector, and getElementsByTagName to locate and interact with specific elements.

4.Content Modification: With the Document Object, you can dynamically update the content of a web page. You can change text, attributes, styles, and even create new elements.

5.Event Handling: The Document Object is involved in managing events that occur within the HTML document. You can attach event listeners to elements within the document to respond to user interactions, such as clicks or keyboard inputs.

6.Traversal: You can navigate through the structure of the document by accessing parent, child, and sibling elements. This traversal capability is essential for many DOM manipulation tasks.

// Window Object

1.The Window Object represents the web browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded. Here are the key characteristics of the Window Object:

2.Global Scope: The Window Object is at the global level, which means that variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword are automatically added as properties of the Window Object. This can lead to variable naming conflicts if not managed properly.

3.Window Properties: It provides access to various properties related to the browser window, such as window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, and window.location.

4.Timers and Intervals: You can use the Window Object to create timers and intervals for executing functions at specified intervals, which is useful for tasks like animations and periodic data retrieval.

5.Navigation Control: The Window Object allows you to control the browser's navigation by opening new windows or tabs, redirecting to different URLs, and managing the browsing history.

6.Dialogs and Alerts: You can use methods like window.alert(), window.confirm(), and window.prompt() to interact with the user through dialog boxes and prompts.
